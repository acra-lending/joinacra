                  I started my job with the company the day after I graduated college. I had a clear vision and purpose that I wanted to gain experience and improve my skills right away. The company, along with my manager, helped establish goals that aligned with my strengths and interest for the future. This company highly focuses on mentoring and training their employees which has definitely helped with my professional development. Throughout the two years I have worked here, my department established a job rotation. This allowed me to enhance my knowledge of HR and get a better understanding of the business. Lastly, I am excited to say that my experience, so far, the management team has wanted me to continue my education and get my SHRM certification.
